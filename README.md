 #Rainfall_Processor LibreOffice Calc Macro
 
This python macro does some basic processing of timeseries data (specifically precipitation, but could work for similar data; stream flows, etc). 

[TODO more description]

Requires the series to be in the form shown in the included Test_Dataset/Generated_Gauge_Timeseries.ods

Stil some kinks to work out for series with gaps/missing data.
